nxkill-2.0.0-4

- Updated copyright to year 2006.

nxkill-2.0.0-3

- Got rid of using getopt library - as there are compilation problems
  on solaris platform (only the limited set of functions was availa-
  ble).

nxkill-2.0.0-2

- Added handle option that will let us send Cygwin signals when we
  know only windows handler for a program. Implements FR12C01251.

nxkill-2.0.0-1

- Opened the 2.0.0 branch based on the 1.6.0-2.

nxkill-1.6.0-2

- New --environment switch to provide information about env variables,
  finding correct paths for tmp and fonts directories and setting
  mount points.

nxkill-1.6.0-1

- Opened the 1.6.0 branch based on the version 1.5.0-6.

nxkill-1.5.0-6

- Switched back to getopt_long usage as getopt_long_only is
  not supported on cygwin.

nxkill-1.5.0-5

- Corrected the format to be compatible with one specified in
  feature request.

- Added the format line that is printed in this same way as
  nxserver is printing.

- Replaced getopt_long with getopt_long_only so we don't get the
  multiple errors when we specify the wrong option.

nxkill-1.5.0-4

- NX Kill is first checking if NX_HOME environment variable
  is present in the system. If it is it will use it as a base
  for the session directories searching. If it's not it's trying
  to get the $HOME/.nx directory. If that directory cannot
  be found error is reported.

nxkill-1.5.0-3

- NX Kill is now expecting the environment variable NX_HOME to
  contain the $HOME/.nx directory that is used to find the session
  directories.

nxkill-1.5.0-2

- Fixed small memory leak when not freeing the memory after session
  name parsing.

- Implemented '--id' parameter handling for '--list' command.
  For now we are only showing the pid of nxproxy that we can get
  from 'session' file.

- Implemented '--id' parameter handling for '--kill' command.
  We can kill a session only by specifying the session id.

nxkill-1.5.0-1

- Opening release of nxkill.

- Recreated the source directory structure based on nxcomp.

- Implemeneted command line arguments parsing mechanism using the
  standard getopt_long function.

- Implemented '--list' command that shows all the session directories
  in .nx directory. We do not yet analyze the contens of session file
  so it is not very reliable. More development will come.

- Implemented '--help' command that is showing the usage help. Review of
  the text shown is needed - as I just took the requirements list from
  the FR.

- Implemented '--version' command that is showing the version of nxkill
  program.

- Implemented '--kill --pid NUMBER [--signal SIGNAL]' command.
  It is sending a signal to the pid specified as a parameter. Signal
  parameter is optional and when is not specified we send SIGTERM.
  '--id' parameter is not yet implemented.
