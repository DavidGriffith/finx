Description: generic font configuration library
 Fontconfig is a font configuration and customization library, which
 does not depend on the X Window System.  It is designed to locate
 fonts within the system and select them according to requirements
 specified by applications.
 .
 Fontconfig is not a rasterization library, nor does it impose a
 particular rasterization library on the application.  The X-specific
 library 'Xft' uses fontconfig along with freetype to specify and
 rasterize fonts.
 .
 This package contains a program to maintain the fontconfig cache
 (fc-cache), and a sample program to list installed fonts (fc-list).
