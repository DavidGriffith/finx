- Fixed the procedure opening the log file. The standard error now
  points to the newly created log, so that we can share the same
  file for all the log facilities.

  closed at the the time we exit()), so that other components can
  keep using the file to print their log information.

nxwin-2.0.0-5

nxwin-2.0.0-4

- Moved the call to exit(), introduced in the previous version, at the
  end of the dispatch loop.

nxwin-2.0.0-3

- It seems that there are still memory errors in the deinitialization
  phase, probably due to a double free or such. The code base is going
  to move forward to the X.org tree so there is not a pressing need to
  investigate the problem. If the client that is disconnecting is our
  only remaining client (that for a NX session is the proxy), then the
  dispatcher will exit without going through the normal close down
  procedure.

- Added some stubs in the NXwin.h header to preserve the independence
  of the NXWin package from the X11 libs.

nxwin-2.0.0-2

- Updated NoMachine copyright notice to the current year.

  Gnome-Text-Editor that they have losen the selection, after select-
  ing some text in a Windows application by Ctrl-C,it's necessary sen-
  ding them a ClearSelecion event when they lose the focus.

nxwin-1.5.0-6

- Fixed TR08C00965. If a window had no WM icon defined, the icon of a
  sibling window became the default. Now use the NoMachine logo.

  or session suspension. If a older agent or a single application
  is detected failure will be notified to nxclient administrator.

nxwin-1.4.0-1

- Opened the 1.4.0 branch.
