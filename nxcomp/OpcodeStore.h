  // X server (by excluding all opcodes used for extensions)

  //
  // Some toolkits query the server only once for extensions'
  // opcodes and share the same settings across all channels.
  // This could be a problem as channels needed to monitor the
  // traffic to find out the extensions' opcodes themselves,
  // so it is important that proxy passes an instance of this
  // class to new channels.
