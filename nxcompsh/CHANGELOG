  environment.

  Solving compilation problem on Solaris.

- Added includes needed for compilation on older systems.

nxcompsh-2.0.0-2

- Modified Makefile.in to produce dll library on Cygwin.

nxcompsh-2.0.0-1

- Opened 2.0.0 branch based on 1.5.0-3 version.

nxcompsh-1.5.0-3

- Given a fresh start to libXcompsh library development. The library
  contains functions that should better end in nxcomp. For the moment
  I don't want to clutter nxcomp any further.

- A test-nxcompsh program is included, time to time executing various
  tests, based on the functionalities being under development.

- Modified the configure.in. Unfortunately the autoconf tools coming
  with Fedora Core 3 have been changed in a way that are now incompa-
  tible with our configure.in, so I'll have to produce the configure
  script on an older version. Niceties of Linux development.
