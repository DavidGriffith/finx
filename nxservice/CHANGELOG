nxservice-3.1.0-1

- Opened the 3.1.0 branch based on nxservice-3.0.0-11.

nxservice-3.0.0-11

- Implemented FR09E01895. Added the possibility to disable use of
  DirectDraw for screen rendering on Windows.

nxservice-3.0.0-10

- Implemented FR12C01225. All the fonts installed by the NX Client for
  Windows are moved to $NX_INSTALLATION_DIR\share\fonts directory.
  Backward compatibility has been maintained.

- Updated BASELINE file in order to include nxcomp-3.0.0-48 and also
  nxcompsh-3.0.0-7.

- Added missing references to TRs in nxservice-3.0.0-8.

nxservice-3.0.0-9

- Use a sub-second timer in checkServiceStart().

nxservice-3.0.0-8

- On Cygwin, in the case of an error, try again to fork() after a
  second, for a maximum of 30 times. This seems to constitute a
  valid workaround to the intermittent fork() failures observed on
  Windows. This solves the TR09E01893.

- Make all the D-* files readable only by the user. This solves the
  TR09E01891.

- Check the pid before killing the process when stopping a service.

- Get rid of the compilation warning issued due to the inclusion of
  <sys/types.h> before <winsock2.h>.

- Add -lws2_32 to compile on the latest Cygwin.

nxservice-3.0.0-7

- Solved TR01E01620. Added function in Service.cpp file, this uses
  the API functions by retrieving a free port on Windows.

- Updated BASELINE file to include nxwin-3.0.0-10, nxesd-3.0.0-4,
  nxcompsh-3.0.0-6, nxkill-3.0.0-4 and nxcomp-3.0.0-43.

nxservice-3.0.0-6

- Updated the NoMachine copyright notice.

nxservice-3.0.0-5

- Changed the copyright attribution from Medialogic to NoMachine.

nxservice-3.0.0-4

- Added '-[no]keyhook' parameter when starting NXWin.

nxservice-3.0.0-3

- Changed the LICENSE file to state that the software is only made
  available under the version 2 of the GPL.

- Added file COPYING.

- Improved some debug logs in Service methods.

nxservice-3.0.0-2

- Updated the copyright notices to the current year.

- Imported changes up to nxservice-2.1.0-10.

- Converted the .Xauthority path from Win32 to Posix format.

- Included the netinet/in.h file in ServiceDisplay.cpp to fix a compi-
  le problem on MacOSX platform.

- The procedure to search a free display where to launch the X Server
  is now based on the socket type.

- Changed the '-nolisten' option from 'unix' to 'local', as it is cur-
  rently used by XFree.

- Fixed TR12D01578. If the service directory path is too long for the
  AF_UNIX socket type, the nxservice launches the nxwin with the op-
  tion '-nolisten unix', so that the connections are accepted on an
  AF_INET socket and the unix socket file is not created.

- Updated the baseline file to include nxcompsh-3.0.0-3, nxwin-3.0.0-2
  and nxcomp-3.0.0-5.

nxservice-3.0.0-1

- Opened the 3.0.0 branch based on 2.1.0-5.

- Updated the baseline file to include the components of branch 3.0.

nxservice-2.1.0-5

- The nxservice is now able to verify the status of launched services.
  Using this system, for example, we can stop the session handshaking
  if a critical service (like nxwin) fails to start informing the nx-
  client about the issue.

- Modified the configure scripts to check whether compiler needs the
  option -Wno-deprecated and accept the options -Wmissing-declarations
  and -Wnested-externs.

- Added various debug messages.

- Updated the baseline file to include nxcomp-2.1.0-4.

nxservice-2.1.0-4

- The path 'System NX Directory\usr\X11R6\lib\X11\fonts' is no longer
  used when we look for a valid font path.

- Fixed a conflicting declaration error compiling in the Mac Intel OSX
  environment.

nxservice-2.1.0-3

- Now the NX client for Windows is able to build the font path option
  adding all the subdirectories located in the 'System NX Directory\
  X11R6\lib\X11\fonts\' folder. This implements FR09D01496.

- Fixed TR09D01503. As the nxwin binary is executed with the execvp()
  function, the options doesn't need to be enclosed between quotes.

- Changed the code to avoid buffer overflows.

- Fixed a problem with the 'make clean' command modifying the Make-
  file.in file.

- Updated the baseline to include nxcomp-2.1.0-3.

  directory of nxservice.

- Added id parameter to specify which is the directory to be used for
  the service.

- Printing the directory used by the program started by nxservice.

nxservice-2.0.0-16

- Fixed problem with stopping NXWin on windows - the wrong id was
  used for stopping - so the whole procedure was failing.

nxservice-2.0.0-15

- Added version parameter.

- When id value following the stop parameter is empty we just quit
  without stopping anything.

nxservice-2.0.0-14

- Printing ID of the deamon being started.

- Added parameter id so we can select which deamon to stop if there
  are more services of one type running.

  is listening.

nxservice-2.0.0-4

  given service.

- Added options file where we put all the parameters used for starting
  a given service.

  functionalites.
